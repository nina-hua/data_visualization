EL CENTRO BRINGS DARING NEW LIFE INTO GRAND OLD HOLLYWOOD  El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is a vibrant new residential rental community offering the best of city living in central Hollywood. Steps away from the legendary intersection of Hollywood and Vine (and the Metro station), the property offers a range of smart and flexible layouts to suit every personality. Studios, lofts, bungalows, penthouses, and classic one- and two-bedroom apartments are available.Acclaimed L.A.-based creative collective Commune Design created El Centro's thoughtfully crafted interiors to feature large windows, high ceilings, walk-in closets, and honed surfaces that aren't too shiny.The urbane El Centro lifestyle centers on the pool, lounge, yoga studio, spa, and fitness center. Passageways and courtyards burst with drought-sensitive landscaping of exotic palms, wild succulents, and specimen cacti from L.A.'s Cactus Store.The project's name, by the way, comes from El Centro Avenue. Going back much further, the root word centrum originally meant the fixed point around which you draw a circle--the middle of it all.With its center-of-everything location, El Centro Apartments & Bungalows is designed to be your new walkable, car-optional, app-enabled, indoor/outdoor, live-work home in the city.CalDRE LIC #00838846  Call Now:  show contact info

You're probably looking for a modern 1 bedroom Apt with a Washer and Dryer in the apartment, in a nice area with nice facilities but are finding them pretty pricey. Anything in this area is over $2000 plus you'd pay utilities on top of that. Please consider this opportunity as it will be a win-win for both of us :)
I have a large 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment and I spend all my time in my bedroom. The living room is empty and the other side of the apartment will also be empty by the end of the month. Private bedroom with walk-in closet and a nice big bathroom.
I have everything you need. Cable TV, wi-fi, housekeeper, all utilities already set up and I'll include in the rent but would appreciate a flat rate contribution towards them of $150 monthly (They are approx $400-500monthly). 
I have a housekeeper monthly. You have your own parking space in the garage and you will feel like you're living in luxury.
I also have a Queen Sleep Number bed, bookshelves, Lighting etc if you need a Furnished bedroom.
Good credit and verifiable proof of income is required to be on the lease (ends May at which time we can renew)
$1000 Deposit

A straight shot down Santa Monica Boulevard to the beaches and in the shadow of the Hollywood Hills, Westwood is centrally located.

A straight shot down Santa Monica Boulevard to the beaches and in the shadow of the Hollywood Hills, Westwood is centrally located.Property Features:
