One of the rooms in my 2 BR Apartment is opening up and I'm looking to fill it ASAP. 
A little about the area:
- The apartment is located in the heart of Cow Hollow, specifically in between Laguna St. and Buchanan St. We are the top apartment so no noise above the apartment. The Urban Remedy juice shop is below us.
- There's great restaurants and bars all around the apartment. Some of the most popular spots include Marengo, Italian Homemade and Perry's.
- Neighborhood bars and staples to the area are Bus Stop and Blue Light.
- Commuting to and from the apartment is super easy. Two public transportation options are SF MUNI (the bus) which picks you up ~20 steps to the right from our front door and Chariot ~20 steps to the left of the front door.
- The apartment is 5 minute walking distance to one of the most desirable views/parks in the entire city: Marina Green and Crissy Field. If you're active and like to get outside, this apartment is great for being able to do that.
A little about me:
- Easy going guy in my mid-late 20's. I've lived in this place for a while and appreciate keeping it tidy. I'm not a clean freak but air on the side of keeping things tidy and respectable for others.
- I enjoy watching sports on the weekends, Netflix etc. 
- I work at a health tech start up and lead our Business Development efforts for the past 4+ years. I travel quite a bit for work (~1 week per month).
- Looking for someone who is not bringing the party back from the bars but can enjoy the pros of living near that scene. Also pays rent on time, every month :)
Text/email me directly if you're seriously interested!

The room is approximately 12x9 feet. Has a decent sized closet.
Rent is $1,065, security deposit $1,130 (deposit is paid directly to the roommate moving out), internet $19.98 each and utilities average $45-85 each (colder months are on the higher end). Shared living room, kitchen, and bathroom. Landlord will require the new roommate and the other two roommates to sign a new 12-month lease. Room is available December 1, 2018.
We share the house with another family who lives in the downstairs apartment (they have a separate entrance). They are really nice. We share laundry and trash cans with them in the backyard. They also have kids, so no parties. It is also a quiet neighborhood so if you like to throw many parties then this is not a good option for you.
The house is in the Silver Terrace neighborhood (Bayview District near the Portola). Street parking only. Close to 4 bus routes, the 8, 9, 24, and 44. Glen Park BART is nearby (44 takes you there). We have gas stations, multiple grocery stores, restaurants, and a Walgreens in walking distance. Also really close to both the 101 and 280 freeways.
About us: 1 guy (mid-30s) and 1 gal (mid-20s). Both of us are artists and we work in luxury retail (her) and museum/higher education (him). We are looking for someone who is clean, respectful, and responsible. Please note that no pets are allowed and the room available is for one person only.

Hey everyone!
I have a lease that ends on November 25th, but I need to move out before November 1st. The building is really centrally located (right across the street from the civic center and Bill Graham Auditorium! The rooftop has an amazing view of the city and the Civic Center Plaza (I watched Metallica from there for free during the recent Dreamforce concert). There is also a gym in the building. The apartment is a junior 1Bedroom (i.e. the bedroom doesn't have a window and it has a sliding door), it has in-unit Washer/Dryer, gas range and wood floors everywhere except the bedroom, which is carpeted. I am planning on selling the couch, the bed, and a table, so it can also be partly furnished! The apartment also has gigabit internet that I already paid for the whole year for, so you get it for free!
The price is pro-rated for the actual amount of time that someone would be in the unit, based on my monthly rent of $2935 (i.e. 25/ show contact info
).
There is an option to extend the lease at a higher price (dictated by the building) of $3025 after November 25 or move out then.",37.777711,-122.418356,downtown / civic / van ness,2018-10-14 10:31:31,2018-10-14 15:06:34,2446.0,False,600.0,1.0,1.0,both,in-unit,none,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco

A spacious 1 bedroom, 1.5 bath at 1,187 square feet and a highly functional floor plan.  The main level consists of a remodeled kitchen, marble counters, half bathroom, and full walk-in closet.  Upstairs one will find a master bedroom, full bathroom, and a loft style office space. The apartment has all new appliances and washer/dryer inside the unit. 
 This building is designated as a landmark of historical significance.  Which also means it is located on bedrock and not landfill.  Re-habbed and retrofitted in 1996, this unit is a classic ""Brick and Timber"" loft with great style and architectural appeal.
The building is situated very well to restaurants, transit, and the downtown commercial district.  A short one block stroll and you will be on the Embarcadero where you will find a well-regarded Seafood restaurant and equally regarded steakhouse.  Across the street is a more casual dinning experience but the closest place to grab a meal.  If you walk another block down the Embarcadero towards the ferry building, you will find a fantastic neighborhood restaurant and bar.  And of course, there is always the Ferry Building itself, with multiple eateries and shops.  You are also a short stroll along the bay to AT&T Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.
One block away on the Embarcadero is the Muni Tram system, which can take you to many places across the city.  A few blocks walk down Spear street toward Market street will take you to the Embarcadero BART station which can take you across the city and under the bay to east bay locations.
$300 per month w/ parking.

I'm going to sublet my apartment in the SF Mission District for up to a year. I'm going to live in the North Bay for awhile but plan to return to the City at some point after one year. 
Apartment will be available to move in anytime between December 1st and the first week in January. 
Written rental agreement would be month to month, but looking for people who plan to stay at least six months and up to a year.
Email me with your preferred time frame, thanks!
This is a top floor 3 to 4 bedroom apartment with 1 1/2 baths, that is suitable for up to 4 people living here. You can use the living room as a fourth bedroom if needed. All rooms have their own real walls/doors, no french doors or partitions. 
Living room/bedroom is large - 250 sq. ft.
There are two other large bedrooms - 156 sq. ft. and 144 sq. ft.
One smaller bedroom - 100 sq. ft., which also has a large walk in closet with shelves, 6 x 4 ft.
There is also a very large storage closet with shelves, drawers and clothing rack in the hallway - 13 x 4 ft.
The apartment can come semi-furnished if you would like, or I can clear it out completely. I have two beds that can stay (a twin and a queen), and possibly a third bed, and a bit of the furniture, such as IKEA wardrobes in two of the bedrooms, and some kitchen supplies.
The apartment is conveniently and centrally located in the Mission district, close to public transportation - BART and many Muni lines (14, 22, 49, 55, 33, J), as well as to Dolores Park, grocery shopping - Whole Foods, Bi Rite, Safeway, plus the shops, cafes, bars, restaurants on Valencia Street.
I keep a clean and quiet home and I'm looking for people who can maintain my home in this way while I'm away.
Please email me with an introduction of yourself and what you're looking for, such as number of people you're looking to rent with and length of stay.

As the undisputed cultural heart of the city, the Mission has a progressive spirit that's constantly evolving and a soul that holds true to its historic Latino roots. Young, exciting, inventive, and flourishing--this is a community that's firing on all cylinders, and the energy is infectious. 1128 Valencia is perfectly located above a quaint  park-let setting between 22nd and 23rd Streets, at the core of the Mission's dynamic action and its trendy Valencia Street corridor--enabling residents walk to the hippest bars, restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues within seconds, or relax with friends at the bistro tables directly outside our front door.
The Mission also has the city's largest concentration of murals and street art, which proudly decorates buildings, fences, garage doors, alleys, and even the ground you're walking on.

There's never a shortage of things to explore--literally right outside your door.
The Mission's micro-climate tends to sit on the sunny side, boasting some of the best weather in the city. As a result, alfresco park-lets and biking abound, but people also flock to the grassy slopes of Dolores Park to catch some of the best views of the city.

If you're moving to the Bay Area for a limited period, or long-term but not had time to find your permanent home, this is a great option.  As long as you see this posting, my apartment is available as I will delete it as soon as it is rented. TEXT me, Martin, at  show contact info
 to view it by appointment.  
THE APARTMENT -  New apartment, almost 1000 sq ft on the ground floor of my 2-story house: one bedroom and a full-size living room (which can be a 2nd bedroom but is the only door to garden), a dining area, den/study/or office, a second computer nook, a fully-modern and equipped kitchen, and a large enclosed back yard & garden. Also a full-size laundry room which is shared only with the apartment upstairs. This is a private home not an apartment house, and I put in the best of everything - granite counters in the kitchen, built-in microwave, gas stove, marble walls & pedestal sink in the bathroom, all bamboo hardwood floors, walk-in closet, etc. Furniture in photos belongs to my current tenant as they had their own, and will be replaced by mine currently stored. (If you have your own furniture I will lower the price.) I have a beautiful large collection of art and carpets - you may choose whatever strikes your fancy! All linens & kitchenware. You can choose from my fine art collection, carpets (if you have no pets), and other items. Or rent or bring in your own furnishings for a discount on the monthly rent. Available November 1 or thereafter as my current tenant of 3 years just moved out of the City last Saturday and I am redoing the interior - painting, refinishing beautiful wooden floors, gardens, etc. If you wish to commit for a shorter period, we can renegotiate the length of our agreement.
AMENITIES - The apartment opens directly onto an enormous all-enclosed garden & yard (perfect for pets), about the size of the house itself. No garage space because there is always plenty of street parking here, so we use it for storage, bikes, the laundry, etc. We have a forced air heating system but it hardly ever gets too hot or too cold.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD - is residential & ultra-safe, close to public transportation and plenty of street parking. Great coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping streets nearby (Noriega, Taraval, & Irving, from 9th to 32nd Avenues. We're across from Lincoln H.S., 3 short blocks from the new Lycee Francaise on 19th Ave, a short bus or bike ride to Stonestown Mall; SFSU, around the corner from a synagogue & a Lutheran church, and not far from the Alice Fong Chinese American public school. It's not far from UCSF (but public transportation to UC Med Center is less than direct). We're 2 short blocks from the jogging/dog-walking path around the 24th Ave reservoir which has a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean & GG Bridge, not far from the now-famous Moraga Mosaic Steps up to Grandview Park with 360* view of the entire city, and 8 blocks from Golden Gate Park, both of which are great for biking, jogging and pet walks.
MUNI & FREEWAYS - On the corner are both Muni buses 48 & 66, and the 19th Ave line is 3 short blocks away. Major streetcars are nearby (Taraval, Noriega, the N Judah) all not far from the West Portal terminal. Easy access to I-280 & 101 if you're driving south to the Peninsula, or north to Marin. It could be as little as 15 minutes to get to or from the Oakland Bay Bridge even during rush hour because Oak & Fell are one-way with staggered lights.
TERMS - 6-month renewable month-to-month lease. Shorter term can be negotiated, especially if you use your own or rented furniture.  No smokers, or big partying people. A lover of gardening will be especially happy because of the great garden in the back and another small one at the entrance. DSL/Broadband & cable TV are already installed, landline telephone line if you need it. We split utilities, which aren't much - barely $100 a month covers gas, electric, water, & trash. Cable &; internet are separate but you pay only half as it's shared with upstairs.
TO SEE APT - I'm having an Open House today, Saturday at 1 or tomorrow, Sunday morning, but please text me for the address, & with a time so we don't get bottled up since the contractor left equipment over the weekend. Texting my cell is better than calling or email. Although my tenant left the City she's happy to to talk with you, so you can ask her anything.

***This is a real apartment available for rent. Not a scam. We own the apartment and the whole building. Looking for nice tenants. We can meet and show you the apartment.

The Inner Mission is one of San Francisco's most vibrant neighborhoods. Homes in the neighborhood include grand, century-old houses, smaller Victorian cottages, and new condo developments that have sprung up in the past couple of years. 
Stroll along Valencia Street any evening, and you'll experience an urban planner's dream: thousands of young residents out for a bite to eat; a standing-room only crowd at the Make Out Room; tuning up their bikes at Freewheel Bike Shop; or checking out the latest avant-garde performance at Dance Mission Theater.
The neighborhood is home to dozens of restaurants serving numerous styles of cuisine, including many taquerias, for which the neighborhood has become famous. Dave Eggers' 826 Valencia foundation for kids offers writing workshops next to Paxton Gate, a store full of curiosities designed to spark anyone's imagination.
Access to public transportation is plentiful in the Mission. In addition to multiple bus lines there are two Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations at 16th Street and Mission Street and 24th Street and Mission Street.

Location:
The Ingleside neighborhood sits in the southwestern section of San Francisco and like its close neighbors, its grounds were originally home to horse racing, roadhouses, and farms. But once the area reached its full potential after the 1906 earthquake, Ingleside became a quiet residential haven that still attracts homebuyers today.
Most of the homes here were built before 1940 and cover a range of architectural styles, with a majority being small- to medium-sized single-family homes. Residents here enjoy quaint Victorian cottages, Mediterranean Revival, and stucco-coated townhomes, as well as Spanish-style abodes.
Ocean Avenue stretches across the entire northern border of Ingleside, serving as the primary commercial strip. What residents can not find here, they can find in nearby neighborhoods -- which along with all of San Francisco -- are accessible by the public transportation lines that access Ingleside.
Notable businesses along Ocean Avenue are the Ingleside Community Center, providing a safe place for youth to study and receive tutoring, as well as the newly remodeled and polished Ingleside Branch Library, and a long-time favorite watering hole, The Ave Bar.
Ingleside is considered one of the more affordable residential neighborhoods in San Francisco. With its location being an amenity itself, with easy proximity to all of the city's offerings, its popularity is bounding, making it an even more alluring destination for homebuyers and renters alike.

We love pets at 388 Beale! Bring your favorite little friend by for a tour today!
Come home to all new. This apartment has just been renovated to feature brand new wood flooring, new stone countertops, and new stainless steel appliances. These new finishes complement the stunning and timeless features we love in this home, including the floor to ceiling windows, high ceilings, and large glass sliding doors to let you onto your private patio.
This massive two bedroom has been converted into a three bedroom with the professional installation of a flex wall in the living room. By adding this wall, we have created a spacious third bedroom while still providing a large living space and open concept kitchen in the home. This wall comes complete with a locking door, and is strong enough to mount a television onto. Nowhere else in SOMA will you find a three bedroom home with this square footage and low price point. Call today for more information!

*Free HDTV w/ Premium Channels
*Free High Speed Wireless Internet 
*Private Deck w/ View

INTRODUCTION: The ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway"" is a fully furnished private large one-bedroom suite with a separate entrance, located right in the heart of the picturesque Noe (No-ee) Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.  Built just above the garden level, this well-appointed stylish accommodation is perfect as temporary housing or an extended vacation rental (31 night minimum lease required). It is clean, secure, smoke-free and pet and eco-friendly. It's ideally suited for one to two persons. 
FLEXIBLE TERMS:  This is a perfect fully furnished space, especially if your are moving in or out of the city, remodeling your home, here for an extended stay for work, visiting family or on a nice long San Francisco vacation. We offer a 30-day lease - which is the required minimum stay - and then month to month thereafter (or prorated portion thereof.) That means if you plan on staying only 31, 32, 33 nights or more, we can accommodate you!
LOCATION: Nestled in the heart of Noe Valley of San Francisco, the ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway"" overlooks our charming garden and surrounding the attractive neighborhood. Noe Valley is also blessed as having one of the sunniest and warmest neighborhoods in the city - an important consideration here in San Francisco.  And Noe Valley is known for its up-scale desirability and charm -- boasting trendy restaurants, bakeries, wine and cheese shops, fashionable apparel boutiques, floral shops and public transportation.  Other rentals like to say they are located near Noe, but the ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway"" is right in the middle of it.
SIZE and LAYOUT: Tucked away from the street noise, this space is a completely private one-bedroom apartment that's much bigger than most hotel suites. Descending one flight of stairs from the street level accesses it. It has an open and bright snack bar as well as a separate dining area. The smart-looking living area adjoins a private deck with a beautiful garden and neighborhood view. A large separate ensuite bedroom, sheltered from outside noise and sunlight, allows you to sleep-in as late as you like. It features an abundance of lighting, ceiling fans, a built-in granite desk, two walk-in closets and a private full size bath.
STYLISH FURNISHINGS:  A granite breakfast bar with bar stools, comfortable couch, coffee table, entertainment console with a wide-screen HDTV, dining set for four, two queen-size beds, a twin-size convertible bed, dresser and a built-in granite desk with an executive chair are tastefully arranged. Elegant, contemporary wall hangings and area rugs enhance the space's ambience.
PRIVATE DECK: You'll enjoy exclusive use of your own spacious wood deck featuring a beautiful view of the neighborhood and the garden below. You will find that this space can be a tranquil sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city.  Deck furniture includes a gas BBQ, chaise lounge and a patio bistro set.
BUSINESS AMENITIES: Secured high-speed wireless internet is included.  A shared laser printer/copier machine is also connected to the network. ""3G"" and ""4G"" cell phone reception is excellent.
ENTERTAINMENT: A 37"" flat-screen HDTV, equipped with cable box is installed in the living area. Local and premium cable channels plus many free on-demand programs and more are included. A second bedroom HDTV also features premium cable channels.  The bedroom is equipped with an I-pod compatible stereo alarm clock.
SEPARATE FULLY EQUIPPED SNACK BAR: New granite countertops, stainless steel sink with disposal, automatic dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, blender, microwave and toaster are installed. Utensils, dishes, glassware, flatware are also provided. 
SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS: You'll have sweet dreams on either queen-sized memory-foam mattress with high thread-count cotton sheets.
PRIVATE BATH: Full size shower with glass enclosure is installed. A designer sink and commode as well as a large toiletry cabinet complete this elegant granite tiled bathroom. 
SEPARATE SHARED LAUNDRY ROOM: A modern washer/gas dryer, utility sink and iron with ironing board, are available for your use, free of charge.
MAID SERVICE:  Once a month maid service is provided by our professional cleaning staff, who will change the sheets and towels, vacuum, dust, polish the wood and glass surfaces and deep clean the kitchen and bathrooms for you.
TRANSIT and PARKING: We are just steps away from the Muni streetcars (J and F-lines) and busses (48-line), the Genentech and Google shuttle coaches and a ten minute walk to BART (24th St Station) and the 24 bus line.  This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available.
LOCAL CONVENIENCES: A ""Whole Foods"" super-market is a five-minute walk away.  Additionally, a convenience store is within a baseball throw from the house, as is a dry cleaning/laundry business. Numerous banks and real-estate agencies are also close-by.
WALKING: We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot (WalkScore of 97 out of 100; see ""Walker's Paradise""). Noe Valley is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly.  Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes that escaped the fire of 1906 adorn the neighborhood.
FITNESS and BICYCLING:  Two local fitness clubs are right around the corner and   Castro's fully equipped two-story gym is a short streetcar ride away. Bicycle rentals are just down the street.  
PET-FRIENDLY:  Your quiet, friendly dog (under 60 pounds) or cat is welcomed here at the ""Enchanted Garden Hideaway.""  Large, lockable doggy doors lead to the backyard for safe 24/7 pet relief and we will take care of any backyard clean up. (Backyard is restricted to pets only.) 
ECO-FRIENDLY: The building is equipped with roof-top electric solar panels, renewable bamboo wood floors and ipe wood decks, environmentally friendly insulation, energy conserving light bulbs, motion activated switches, energy-saving appliances, water-conserving toilets and shower heads, a new large-capacity gas-saving water heater and a new high-efficiency central-air heater with a smart thermostat.",37.751705,-122.42743700000001,noe valley,2018-10-04 11:06:19,2018-10-11 20:36:38,4399.0,False,800.0,1.0,1.0,both,shared,none,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco

Available for lease is a 1400sf 2bed, 2ba + den apt (unfurnished) in the NEMA building in SOMA -20th floor apt 2001. Corner facing with amazing views of the city and Civic Center.  I've lived at NEMA for over two years and love the building as it has all I could want in a community building. Great amenities, staff, technology, events and neighbors.
My family has to relocate and we are looking for someone to move in to our unit and start a new l2 mo lease. 
This building is perfect for employees of Uber (same block), Square (same block), Twitter (across the street) to name a few among many others within walking distance. There are plenty of their employees within the building too so you will be in good company to network and or collaborate. The building is also 1 block away from Muni and Bart stops.

Location & POI Distances
This furnished apartment is located in the fast-growing neighborhood of Rincon Hill. One of the primary appeals of the area is its close proximity to downtown offices, public transit (BART), shopping and dining. A walk along the waterfront on the Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge is just one of the routes that Rincon Hill invites you to explore on foot. A must-do Saturday morning activity is a walk down to the Farmer's Market near the Ferry Building. Emerald Park is also in close distance.  Folsom St & Beale St Station is only 2 minutes away.

Furnished, clean and well-equipped studio apartment with en suite washer and dryer, full kitchen, and a lovely front patio and backyard garden.  We're walking distance from the city's light rail and regional train lines, as well as some of the best shopping, night life, architecture, and neighborhood feel.  
*** 31 Day Minimum Stay ***
The main room includes the bedroom with Queen size bed, writing desk, fold-out sofa, sitting chair, 2 closets, and dining bar with two seats.  The main room is open to the fully equipped kitchen (stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, coffee maker, French press, coffee grinder, microwave). The TV is a Samsung flat screen with cable TV channels and a nice DVD library.  
Down the hallway you'll find the spacious bath with linens provided (remodeled in March 2018), and further down the hallway, there is a laundry room with additional storage.  Yes,  the washer and dryer is just for you.  
The front garden has a bistro table and chairs.  The backyard has a big patio and a garden and table and chairs and hammock.  Perfect for relaxing outside and enjoying the sunshine or the starry nights.
We include maid service about every 2 weeks, or twice per month.  So if you stay for 1 month, the rate includes the maid service before your arrival, as well as half-way through your stay.
The apartment has been thoughtfully furnished with the big things, as well as the little things you might need ... hair dryer, shampoo & soap, laundry detergent, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, umbrellas, iron, ironing board.
We're near 27th and Dolores/Guerrero, at the intersection of three fantastic neighborhoods ... the Mission, Bernal Heights, and Noe Valley.  
Grocery Stores:  The 24-Hour Safeway on Mission St is a 5 minute-walk away, and the Whole Foods on 24th St is a 15-minute walk. The Valencia Market and 26th & Guerrero Market are both on the way home from the BART station.  
It's an easy (very flat) walk from our apartment to 24th St Mission BART or the J-Church to get downtown for cable cars, museums, Chinatown, Union Square, and everything our fair city is known for.    And yes, we are a short walk to the tech shuttle stops.
PRICING
If staying for 6-month lease, the rent is $2900 per month, which includes the maid service every 2 weeks.
If not signing a 6-month lease, then the rent is $3300 per month.
Above includes $250-$375 per month we pay for maid service, as well as $300 per month you'd have to pay in water, electric, gas, trash pickup, cable TV, internet, and phone, at some other place.  So when you subtract those things out, which we are paying for you, that's less than $2400 per month in rent on the 6-month lease.  And when you consider how nicely the place is furnished, from the pots and pans and dishes, down to fresh linens and towels, which you'd otherwise have to buy  ... you've got a pretty awesome deal here.",37.747033,-122.42468999999998,noe valley,2018-10-07 16:50:23,2018-10-11 00:05:17,2900.0,False,500.0,0.0,1.0,none,in-unit,street,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco

 About the Community:
 Grosvenor Court is a community with a friendly staff that wants to make your experience here a pleasant one. Here at Grosvenor Court, we strive to provide a living environment that is quiet, clean and a place where you will feel at home. Grosvenor Court Apartments is located in San Francisco's prestigious Pacific Heights Neighborhood. Nestled on top of the hill at 2055 Sacramento Street, Grosvenor Court is located directly across the street from Lafayette Park. On warm days, the green grass of this two-square-block park is full of sunbathers and dog walkers. The park features tennis courts, playground, and jogging paths. The neighborhood remains generally quiet and residential, with the majority of its activity clustered around Fillmore and Polk Streets with many coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping opportunities.

Are you sick of only seeing cramped Tenderloin apartments for you and your little critter(s)? Well do yourself a favor and come off the beaten path to see this unique studio in the City's most underrated neighborhood! Great location for UCSF-Mission Bay students and workers or artists with studios in/near the Box Shop or Hunters Point Shipyard. 
This lower-unit apartment is in a 1937 house 40 steps above the street and directly across the street from the Bay and India Basin Shoreline Park, with a small yard space and amazing water views. The unit has Pergo floors, draft-free windows, a real kitchen, and updated electrical, bathroom, and kitchen space. A full size washer and dryer are right in the unit to save you the hassle of the laundromat. The apartment is in great condition and we took care to preserve its old-school charm.
The bright living space has lots of exposed wood, wall length built in shelves and looks out onto a small yard and San Francisco Bay. The separate kitchen is 3 steps up from the living space and has enough room for a small dining table. The counters, sink, refrigerator and gas stove were replaced a few years ago. We kept the original period wall cabinet and built-in ironing board.
There is a small front yard with a wide view of the Bay and some planting space. All around are grass, trees, flowers, a picket fence, and lots of birds making the space great for entertaining, or just lounging around. 
This is a diverse and safe neighborhood of owner-occupants like ourselves, artists, and long-time renters. We live upstairs with our two school age boys. You can check out some info about the India Basin Neighborhood Association at www.indiabasin.org.
India Basin Shoreline Park and Heron's Head Park are across the street. Speakeasy Brewery & Tap-room is a 5 minute walk away and open for your beer drinking pleasure. There is no designated parking, but street parking is never a problem. Very easy access to the 101 and 280 freeways, 15 minute drive to downtown SF, 10 minutes to SFO. The 19-Polk stops at the bottom of our stairs and the 44-O'Shaughnessy is a block away. 3rd Street light rail is 15 minute walk away",37.73307,-122.377649,India Basin,2018-10-06 09:02:48,2018-10-14 12:57:01,1800.0,False,425.0,0.0,1.0,both,in-unit,street,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco

INTRODUCTION: The ""City View Apartment"" is a fully furnished private large one-bedroom suite with a separate entrance, located right in the heart of picturesque the Noe (No-ee) Valley neighborhood of San Francisco.  Overlooking the city by the bay, this well-appointed stylish accommodation is perfect as temporary housing or an extended vacation (31 night minimum lease required). It is clean, secure, smoke-free and pet and eco-friendly and it's ideally suited for one to two persons. 
FLEXIBLE TERMS:  This is a perfect fully furnished space, especially if your are moving in or out of the city, remodeling your home, here for an extended stay for work, visiting family or on a nice long San Francisco vacation. We offer a 30-day lease - which is the required minimum stay - and then month to month thereafter (or prorated portion thereof.) That means if you plan on staying only 31, 32, 33 nights or more, we can accommodate you!
LOCATION: Nestled in the heart of Noe Valley of San Francisco, the ""City View Apartment"" is uniquely perched overlooking the city and the bay, but without having to climb any hills to get to the house. Noe Valley is also blessed as having one of the sunniest and warmest neighborhoods in the city - an important consideration here in San Francisco  and Noe Valley is known for its up-scale desirability and charm, boasting trendy restaurants, bakeries, wine and cheese shops, fashionable apparel boutiques, floral shops and public transportation.  Other rentals like to say they are located near Noe, but the ""City View Apartment"" is right in the middle of it.
SIZE and LAYOUT: Tucked away from the street noise, this one-bedroom apartment is about the size of a hotel suite. Its open kitchen and bright living area adjoins a large private deck with outstanding panoramic views. A separate bedroom adjoins the living area. It has a private full size bath and there are no stairs to climb.
STYLISH FURNISHINGS:  A breakfast bar with bar stools, twin lounge chairs, coffee table, entertainment console with a wide-screen HDTV, queen-size bed with nightstands, dresser and work desk and chair are tastefully arranged. Elegant, contemporary wall hangings and area rugs enhance the space's ambience.
PRIVATE DECK: You'll enjoy exclusive use of your own spacious wood deck with panoramic views of the city, the bay and the neighborhood gardens below. You will find that this space can be a tranquil sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city.  Deck furniture includes a gas BBQ, chaise lounge and a patio bistro set.
BUSINESS AMENITIES: Secured high-speed wireless internet is included.  A shared laser printer/copier is also connected to the network. ""3G"" and ""4G"" cell phone reception is excellent.
ENTERTAINMENT: A 42"" flat-screen HDTV, equipped with cable box is installed in the living area. Local and premium cable channels plus many free on-demand programs and more are available. The bedroom is equipped with an I-pod compatible stereo alarm clock.
NICELY EQUIPPED MODERN KITCHEN: Granite countertops, sink with disposal, dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, microwave, gas range and toaster-oven are installed. Kitchen utensils, dishes, glassware, flatware and cookware also provided. Just right for breakfast in the morning or an evening snack. 
SLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS: You'll have sweet dreams on the queen-sized Premium memory foam mattress. All linens are high thread-count cotton sheets.
PRIVATE BATH: Full size tub/shower with glass enclosure is installed. All cotton bath towels, are provided.
SEPARATE SHARED LAUNDRY ROOM: A modern washer/gas dryer, utility sink and iron with ironing board are available for your use, free of charge.
MAID SERVICE:  Once a month maid service is provided by our professional cleaning staff, who will change the sheets and towels, vacuum, dust, polish the wood and glass surfaces and deep clean the kitchen and bathrooms for you.
TRANSIT and PARKING: We are just steps away from the Muni streetcars (J and F-lines) and busses (48-line), the Genentech and Google shuttle coaches and a ten minute walk to BART (24th St Station) and the 24 bus line.  This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available.
LOCAL CONVENIENCES: A ""Whole Foods"" super-market is a five-minute walk away.  Additionally, a convenience store is within a baseball throw from the house, as is a dry cleaning/laundry business. Numerous banks and real-estate agencies are also close-by.
WALKING: We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot (WalkScore of 97 out of 100; see ""Walker's Paradise""). Noe Valley is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly.  Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes that escaped the fire of 1906 adorn the neighborhood.
FITNESS and BICYCLING:  Two local fitness clubs are right around the corner and   Castro's fully equipped two-story gym is a short streetcar ride away. Bicycle rentals are just down the street.  
PET-FRIENDLY:  Your quiet, friendly dog (under 60 pounds) or cat is welcomed here at the ""City View Suite.""  Large, lockable doggy doors lead to the backyard for safe 24/7 pet relief and we will take care of any backyard clean up. (Backyard is restricted to pets only.)
ECO-FRIENDLY: The building is equipped with roof-top electric solar panels, renewable bamboo wood floors and ipe wood decks, environmentally friendly insulation, energy conserving light bulbs, motion activated switches, energy-saving appliances, water-conserving toilets and shower heads, a new large-capacity gas-saving water heater and a new high-efficiency central-air heater with a smart thermostat.",37.751705,-122.42743700000001,noe valley,2018-10-04 11:24:36,2018-10-11 20:35:07,4399.0,False,500.0,1.0,1.0,both,shared,street,sfbay_sfc,San Francisco,San Francisco,CA,San Francisco

Large windows in each of the two-, three- and four-bedroom configurations provide generous natural light and - in some cases - Pacific Ocean views that rival those of neighboring Sea Cliff. Though the standard foghorn soundtrack might say otherwise, sunsets here are more often fiery oranges and reds than shades of gray.Outside, native plants and grasses share space with organic community gardens, neighborhood gathering spaces, bike racks, and playgrounds. Nearby stops for the PresidiGo Shuttle make for easy access to the Presidio's Main Post and the free shuttle to downtown San Francisco.Get to Know the Presidio

This beautiful, newly remodeled duplex sits on an extremely quiet, tree-lined block, steps away from the Marina Green and Crissy Field.

The interior space is brand new and it benefits from a top to bottom remodel. The level of quality and refinement is clear from the moment one walks into the entry foyer, and is consistent throughout the entire interior space.

The Master Suite encompasses the entire 3rd floor of the property and it enjoys virtually unobstructed views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.    Spanning almost 1,000 square feet, the master suite creates an opulent, relaxing atmosphere throughout.   Rarely do properties of this caliber come onto the rental market, so act quickly.

(NEXT OPEN HOUSE is Wed Oct 17 6-7pm. Current tenants are in the midst of moving this weekend, so no showings until vacant.)  
This flat is in a lovely five unit Romeo-style apartment building on a quiet street in SoMa, fully remodeled to the studs in 2016. It's a 3-bedroom, one bath flat, with open kitchen/sitting room with breakfast bar. 
All new electrical, plumbing, insulation, walls, fixtures, etc. Sleek, quiet, efficient electric heating in each bedroom with separate thermostats. Brand new and cool bathroom with waterfall sink and tons of bathroom storage. New oak hardwood floors (no, not that Pergo sh*t you see all the time -- actual hardwood installed by an old Italian guy!). Washer/Dryer in the unit. All new cabinetry, granite kitchen. Dishwasher, garbage disposal. 
Plenty of hallway and bedroom closet space.
I live next door, so there is not a management company that comes when they want, and I care about the quality of the tenants because I live next to you!
It's small square-footage-wise, and each of the bedrooms is about the same size, making it better suited to roommates than to a couple looking for a larger master bedroom. But it's on Natoma between 7th & 8th in the heart of SoMa, 1.5 blocks from Civic Center BART/Muni, around the corner from hot restaurants, a block or two from SoMa clubs and nightlife, walkable to Metreon, City Hall, BART, CalTrain. All the tech company shuttle buses pass right by at 7th and Mission. On Street Parking, but walkable to Twitter, Zinga, Uber, Facebook, Google. 
Asking $4200. That's only $1400 a room, so a very good deal in SoMa.  Address is 618 Natoma Street #2, near 7th.  Available Oct 16. Email reply above or text  show contact info

This large one bedroom unit has lots of light, hardwood floors and a porch swing for Summer warm days. This building has an older style layout, as it was probably built in the 1870's and somehow survived the earthquake and fire in 1906. It does have all the modern conveniences of a kitchen and laundry room in the unit. There are large skylights which flood the kitchen with light and a back porch for growing orchids.
