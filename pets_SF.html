The Urban Remedy juice shop is below us.\n- There's great restaurants and bars all around the apartment. Some of the most popular spots include Marengo, Italian Homemade and Perry's.\n- Neighborhood bars and staples to the area are Bus Stop and Blue Light.\n- Commuting to and from the apartment is super easy. Two public transportation options are SF MUNI (the bus) which picks you up ~20 steps to the right from our front door and Chariot ~20 steps to the left of the front door.\n- The apartment is 5 minute walking distance to one of the most desirable views/parks in the entire city: Marina Green and Crissy Field. If you're active and like to get outside, this apartment is great for being able to do that.\nA little about me:\n- Easy going guy in my mid-late 20's. I've lived in this place for a while and appreciate keeping it tidy. I'm not a clean freak but air on the side of keeping things tidy and respectable for others.\n- I enjoy watching sports on the weekends, Netflix etc. \n- I work at a health tech start up and lead our Business Development efforts for the past 4+ years. I travel quite a bit for work (~1 week per month).\n- Looking for someone who is not bringing the party back from the bars but can enjoy the pros of living near that scene. Also pays rent on time, every month :)\nText/email me directly if you're seriously interested!\nIdeal move in date is ASAP October 15th.

As long as you see this posting, my apartment is available as I will delete it as soon as it is rented. TEXT me, Martin, at  show contact info\n to view it by appointment.  \nTHE APARTMENT -  New apartment, almost 1000 sq ft on the ground floor of my 2-story house: one bedroom and a full-size living room (which can be a 2nd bedroom but is the only door to garden), a dining area, den/study/or office, a second computer nook, a fully-modern and equipped kitchen, and a large enclosed back yard & garden. Also a full-size laundry room which is shared only with the apartment upstairs. This is a private home not an apartment house, and I put in the best of everything - granite counters in the kitchen, built-in microwave, gas stove, marble walls & pedestal sink in the bathroom, all bamboo hardwood floors, walk-in closet, etc. Furniture in photos belongs to my current tenant as they had their own, and will be replaced by mine currently stored. (If you have your own furniture I will lower the price.) I have a beautiful large collection of art and carpets - you may choose whatever strikes your fancy! All linens & kitchenware. You can choose from my fine art collection, carpets (if you have no pets), and other items. Or rent or bring in your own furnishings for a discount on the monthly rent. Available November 1 or thereafter as my current tenant of 3 years just moved out of the City last Saturday and I am redoing the interior - painting, refinishing beautiful wooden floors, gardens, etc. If you wish to commit for a shorter period, we can renegotiate the length of our agreement.\nAMENITIES - The apartment opens directly onto an enormous all-enclosed garden & yard (perfect for pets), about the size of the house itself. No garage space because there is always plenty of street parking here, so we use it for storage, bikes, the laundry, etc. We have a forced air heating system but it hardly ever gets too hot or too cold.\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD - is residential & ultra-safe, close to public transportation and plenty of street parking. Great coffee shops, restaurants, and shopping streets nearby (Noriega, Taraval, & Irving, from 9th to 32nd Avenues. We're across from Lincoln H.S., 3 short blocks from the new Lycee Francaise on 19th Ave, a short bus or bike ride to Stonestown Mall; SFSU, around the corner from a synagogue & a Lutheran church, and not far from the Alice Fong Chinese American public school. It's not far from UCSF (but public transportation to UC Med Center is less than direct). We're 2 short blocks from the jogging/dog-walking path around the 24th Ave reservoir which has a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean & GG Bridge, not far from the now-famous Moraga Mosaic Steps up to Grandview Park with 360* view of the entire city, and 8 blocks from Golden Gate Park, both of which are great for biking, jogging and pet walks.\nMUNI & FREEWAYS - On the corner are both Muni buses 48 & 66, and the 19th Ave line is 3 short blocks away. Major streetcars are nearby (Taraval, Noriega, the N Judah) all not far from the West Portal terminal. Easy access to I-280 & 101 if you're driving south to the Peninsula, or north to Marin. It could be as little as 15 minutes to get to or from the Oakland Bay Bridge even during rush hour because Oak & Fell are one-way with staggered lights.\nTERMS - 6-month renewable month-to-month lease. Shorter term can be negotiated, especially if you use your own or rented furniture.  No smokers, or big partying people. A lover of gardening will be especially happy because of the great garden in the back and another small one at the entrance. DSL/Broadband & cable TV are already installed, landline telephone line if you need it. We split utilities, which aren't much - barely $100 a month covers gas, electric, water, & trash. Cable &; internet are separate but you pay only half as it's shared with upstairs.\nTO SEE APT - I'm having an Open House today, Saturday at 1 or tomorrow, Sunday morning, but please text me for the address, & with a time so we don't get bottled up since the contractor left equipment over the weekend. Texting my cell is better than calling or email.

But once the area reached its full potential after the 1906 earthquake, Ingleside became a quiet residential haven that still attracts homebuyers today.\nMost of the homes here were built before 1940 and cover a range of architectural styles, with a majority being small- to medium-sized single-family homes. Residents here enjoy quaint Victorian cottages, Mediterranean Revival, and stucco-coated townhomes, as well as Spanish-style abodes.\nOcean Avenue stretches across the entire northern border of Ingleside, serving as the primary commercial strip. What residents can not find here, they can find in nearby neighborhoods -- which along with all of San Francisco -- are accessible by the public transportation lines that access Ingleside.\nNotable businesses along Ocean Avenue are the Ingleside Community Center, providing a safe place for youth to study and receive tutoring, as well as the newly remodeled and polished Ingleside Branch Library, and a long-time favorite watering hole, The Ave Bar.\nIngleside is considered one of the more affordable residential neighborhoods in San Francisco. With its location being an amenity itself, with easy proximity to all of the city's offerings, its popularity is bounding, making it an even more alluring destination for homebuyers and renters alike.\nJackie Tom - Leasing Agent for Owner License # 01549629 / Broker Rentals In SF 1318 Hayes Street San Francisco CA 94117.

Built just above the garden level, this well-appointed stylish accommodation is perfect as temporary housing or an extended vacation rental (31 night minimum lease required). It is clean, secure, smoke-free and pet and eco-friendly. It's ideally suited for one to two persons. \nFLEXIBLE TERMS:  This is a perfect fully furnished space, especially if your are moving in or out of the city, remodeling your home, here for an extended stay for work, visiting family or on a nice long San Francisco vacation. We offer a 30-day lease - which is the required minimum stay - and then month to month thereafter (or prorated portion thereof.) That means if you plan on staying only 31, 32, 33 nights or more, we can accommodate you!\nLOCATION: Nestled in the heart of Noe Valley of San Francisco, the \"Enchanted Garden Hideaway\" overlooks our charming garden and surrounding the attractive neighborhood. Noe Valley is also blessed as having one of the sunniest and warmest neighborhoods in the city - an important consideration here in San Francisco.  And Noe Valley is known for its up-scale desirability and charm -- boasting trendy restaurants, bakeries, wine and cheese shops, fashionable apparel boutiques, floral shops and public transportation.  Other rentals like to say they are located near Noe, but the \"Enchanted Garden Hideaway\" is right in the middle of it.\nSIZE and LAYOUT: Tucked away from the street noise, this space is a completely private one-bedroom apartment that's much bigger than most hotel suites. Descending one flight of stairs from the street level accesses it. It has an open and bright snack bar as well as a separate dining area. The smart-looking living area adjoins a private deck with a beautiful garden and neighborhood view. A large separate ensuite bedroom, sheltered from outside noise and sunlight, allows you to sleep-in as late as you like. It features an abundance of lighting, ceiling fans, a built-in granite desk, two walk-in closets and a private full size bath.\nSTYLISH FURNISHINGS:  A granite breakfast bar with bar stools, comfortable couch, coffee table, entertainment console with a wide-screen HDTV, dining set for four, two queen-size beds, a twin-size convertible bed, dresser and a built-in granite desk with an executive chair are tastefully arranged. Elegant, contemporary wall hangings and area rugs enhance the space's ambience.\nPRIVATE DECK: You'll enjoy exclusive use of your own spacious wood deck featuring a beautiful view of the neighborhood and the garden below. You will find that this space can be a tranquil sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city.  Deck furniture includes a gas BBQ, chaise lounge and a patio bistro set.\nBUSINESS AMENITIES: Secured high-speed wireless internet is included.  A shared laser printer/copier machine is also connected to the network. \"3G\" and \"4G\" cell phone reception is excellent.\nENTERTAINMENT: A 37\" flat-screen HDTV, equipped with cable box is installed in the living area. Local and premium cable channels plus many free on-demand programs and more are included. A second bedroom HDTV also features premium cable channels.  The bedroom is equipped with an I-pod compatible stereo alarm clock.\nSEPARATE FULLY EQUIPPED SNACK BAR: New granite countertops, stainless steel sink with disposal, automatic dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, blender, microwave and toaster are installed. Utensils, dishes, glassware, flatware are also provided. \nSLEEPING ACCOMMODATIONS: You'll have sweet dreams on either queen-sized memory-foam mattress with high thread-count cotton sheets.\nPRIVATE BATH: Full size shower with glass enclosure is installed. A designer sink and commode as well as a large toiletry cabinet complete this elegant granite tiled bathroom. \nSEPARATE SHARED LAUNDRY ROOM: A modern washer/gas dryer, utility sink and iron with ironing board, are available for your use, free of charge.\nMAID SERVICE:  Once a month maid service is provided by our professional cleaning staff, who will change the sheets and towels, vacuum, dust, polish the wood and glass surfaces and deep clean the kitchen and bathrooms for you.\nTRANSIT and PARKING: We are just steps away from the Muni streetcars (J and F-lines) and busses (48-line), the Genentech and Google shuttle coaches and a ten minute walk to BART (24th St Station) and the 24 bus line.  This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available.\nLOCAL CONVENIENCES: A \"Whole Foods\" super-market is a five-minute walk away.  Additionally, a convenience store is within a baseball throw from the house, as is a dry cleaning/laundry business. Numerous banks and real-estate agencies are also close-by.\nWALKING: We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot (WalkScore of 97 out of 100; see \"Walker's Paradise\"). Noe Valley is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly.  Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes that escaped the fire of 1906 adorn the neighborhood.\nFITNESS and BICYCLING:  Two local fitness clubs are right around the corner and   Castro's fully equipped two-story gym is a short streetcar ride away. Bicycle rentals are just down the street.  \nPET-FRIENDLY:  Your quiet, friendly dog (under 60 pounds) or cat is welcomed here at the \"Enchanted Garden Hideaway.\"  Large, lockable doggy doors lead to the backyard for safe 24/7 pet relief and we will take care of any backyard clean up. (Backyard is restricted to pets only.) \nECO-FRIENDLY: The building is equipped with roof-top electric solar panels, renewable bamboo wood floors and ipe wood decks, environmentally friendly insulation, energy conserving light bulbs, motion activated switches, energy-saving appliances, water-conserving toilets and shower heads, a new large-capacity gas-saving water heater and a new high-efficiency central-air heater with a smart thermostat.", "latitude": 37.751705, "longitude": -122.42743700000001, "city_text": "noe valley", "date_posted": "2018-10-04 11:06:19", "date_updated": "2018-10-11 20:36:38", "price": 4399.0, "deleted": false, "sqft": 800.0, "bedrooms": 1.0, "bathrooms": 1.0, "pets": "both", "laundry": "shared", "parking": "none", "craigslist": "sfbay_sfc", "place": "San Francisco", "city": "San Francisco", "state": "CA", "county": "San Francisco"}, {"title": "$3196 / 466ft2 - Lovely Studio Home located on Penthouse Floor!

We're walking distance from the city's light rail and regional train lines, as well as some of the best shopping, night life, architecture, and neighborhood feel.  \n*** 31 Day Minimum Stay ***\nThe main room includes the bedroom with Queen size bed, writing desk, fold-out sofa, sitting chair, 2 closets, and dining bar with two seats.  The main room is open to the fully equipped kitchen (stove, dishwasher, refrigerator, coffee maker, French press, coffee grinder, microwave). The TV is a Samsung flat screen with cable TV channels and a nice DVD library.  \nDown the hallway you'll find the spacious bath with linens provided (remodeled in March 2018), and further down the hallway, there is a laundry room with additional storage.  Yes,  the washer and dryer is just for you.  \nThe front garden has a bistro table and chairs.  The backyard has a big patio and a garden and table and chairs and hammock.  Perfect for relaxing outside and enjoying the sunshine or the starry nights.\nWe include maid service about every 2 weeks, or twice per month.  So if you stay for 1 month, the rate includes the maid service before your arrival, as well as half-way through your stay.\nThe apartment has been thoughtfully furnished with the big things, as well as the little things you might need ... hair dryer, shampoo & soap, laundry detergent, dish soap and dishwasher detergent, umbrellas, iron, ironing board.\nWe're near 27th and Dolores/Guerrero, at the intersection of three fantastic neighborhoods ... the Mission, Bernal Heights, and Noe Valley.  \nGrocery Stores:  The 24-Hour Safeway on Mission St is a 5 minute-walk away, and the Whole Foods on 24th St is a 15-minute walk. The Valencia Market and 26th & Guerrero Market are both on the way home from the BART station.  \nIt's an easy (very flat) walk from our apartment to 24th St Mission BART or the J-Church to get downtown for cable cars, museums, Chinatown, Union Square, and everything our fair city is known for.    And yes, we are a short walk to the tech shuttle stops.\nPRICING\nIf staying for 6-month lease, the rent is $2900 per month, which includes the maid service every 2 weeks.\nIf not signing a 6-month lease, then the rent is $3300 per month.\nAbove includes $250-$375 per month we pay for maid service, as well as $300 per month you'd have to pay in water, electric, gas, trash pickup, cable TV, internet, and phone, at some other place.  So when you subtract those things out, which we are paying for you, that's less than $2400 per month in rent on the 6-month lease.  And when you consider how nicely the place is furnished, from the pots and pans and dishes, down to fresh linens and towels, which you'd otherwise have to buy  ... you've got a pretty awesome deal here.", "latitude": 37.747033, "longitude": -122.42468999999998, "city_text": "noe valley", "date_posted": "2018-10-07 16:50:23", "date_updated": "2018-10-11 00:05:17", "price": 2900.0, "deleted": false, "sqft": 500.0, "bedrooms": 0.0, "bathrooms": 1.0, "pets": "none", "laundry": "in-unit", "parking": "street", "craigslist": "sfbay_sfc", "place": "San Francisco", "city": "San Francisco", "state": "CA", "county": "San Francisco"}, {"title": "$4550 / 2br - 976ft2 - Noe Valley/Mission 2 Bedroom Apartment (noe valley)\n  \n    \n    hide this posting\n  \n  \n    \n    unhide", "text": "QR Code Link to This Post\n            \n        \nThe building is located on 30th Street just off of Dolores.

It is clean, secure, smoke-free and pet and eco-friendly and it's ideally suited for one to two persons. \nFLEXIBLE TERMS:  This is a perfect fully furnished space, especially if your are moving in or out of the city, remodeling your home, here for an extended stay for work, visiting family or on a nice long San Francisco vacation. We offer a 30-day lease - which is the required minimum stay - and then month to month thereafter (or prorated portion thereof.) That means if you plan on staying only 31, 32, 33 nights or more, we can accommodate you!\nLOCATION: Nestled in the heart of Noe Valley of San Francisco, the \"City View Apartment\" is uniquely perched overlooking the city and the bay, but without having to climb any hills to get to the house. Noe Valley is also blessed as having one of the sunniest and warmest neighborhoods in the city - an important consideration here in San Francisco  and Noe Valley is known for its up-scale desirability and charm, boasting trendy restaurants, bakeries, wine and cheese shops, fashionable apparel boutiques, floral shops and public transportation.  Other rentals like to say they are located near Noe, but the \"City View Apartment\" is right in the middle of it.\nSIZE and LAYOUT: Tucked away from the street noise, this one-bedroom apartment is about the size of a hotel suite. Its open kitchen and bright living area adjoins a large private deck with outstanding panoramic views. A separate bedroom adjoins the living area. It has a private full size bath and there are no stairs to climb.\nSTYLISH FURNISHINGS:  A breakfast bar with bar stools, twin lounge chairs, coffee table, entertainment console with a wide-screen HDTV, queen-size bed with nightstands, dresser and work desk and chair are tastefully arranged. Elegant, contemporary wall hangings and area rugs enhance the space's ambience.\nPRIVATE DECK: You'll enjoy exclusive use of your own spacious wood deck with panoramic views of the city, the bay and the neighborhood gardens below. You will find that this space can be a tranquil sanctuary in the middle of the bustling city.  Deck furniture includes a gas BBQ, chaise lounge and a patio bistro set.\nBUSINESS AMENITIES: Secured high-speed wireless internet is included.  A shared laser printer/copier is also connected to the network. \"3G\" and \"4G\" cell phone reception is excellent.\nENTERTAINMENT: A 42\" flat-screen HDTV, equipped with cable box is installed in the living area. Local and premium cable channels plus many free on-demand programs and more are available. The bedroom is equipped with an I-pod compatible stereo alarm clock.\nNICELY EQUIPPED MODERN KITCHEN: Granite countertops, sink with disposal, dishwasher, refrigerator/freezer, coffee maker, microwave, gas range and toaster-oven are installed.

This makes getting around town a breeze without a car. Street parking is also available.\nLOCAL CONVENIENCES: A \"Whole Foods\" super-market is a five-minute walk away.  Additionally, a convenience store is within a baseball throw from the house, as is a dry cleaning/laundry business. Numerous banks and real-estate agencies are also close-by.\nWALKING: We recommend exploring Noe Valley on foot (WalkScore of 97 out of 100; see \"Walker's Paradise\"). Noe Valley is a safe, well-lit, police patrolled, up-scale neighborhood that is pedestrian friendly.  Loads of enchanting, eye-popping Victorian homes that escaped the fire of 1906 adorn the neighborhood.\nFITNESS and BICYCLING:  Two local fitness clubs are right around the corner and   Castro's fully equipped two-story gym is a short streetcar ride away. Bicycle rentals are just down the street.  \nPET-FRIENDLY:  Your quiet, friendly dog (under 60 pounds) or cat is welcomed here at the \"City View Suite.\"  Large, lockable doggy doors lead to the backyard for safe 24/7 pet relief and we will take care of any backyard clean up.

Large windows in each of the two-, three- and four-bedroom configurations provide generous natural light and - in some cases - Pacific Ocean views that rival those of neighboring Sea Cliff. Though the standard foghorn soundtrack might say otherwise, sunsets here are more often fiery oranges and reds than shades of gray.Outside, native plants and grasses share space with organic community gardens, neighborhood gathering spaces, bike racks, and playgrounds.
